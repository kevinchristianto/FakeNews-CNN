# Instructions
1. Download the FakeNewsNet dataset from [GitHub](https://github.com/KaiDMML/FakeNewsNet)
2. Place Full dataset.ipynb in the same directory as the gossipcop and politifact folders and run it
3. Ensure that dataset.csv is accessible to Graph Model.ipynb and then run the notebook
    * I recommend running the notebook on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) with a GPU accelerated instance
    * If you run it on your own machine, comment out the code about Google Drive and make sure dataset.csv can be read by Python
